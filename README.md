Excited to embark on a new project leveraging my expertise in AWS services! üöÄ

In this initiative, I will orchestrate a robust CI/CD pipeline using AWS tools, starting with fetching code from CodeCommit. The journey unfolds with CodeBuild compiling the project, generating a valuable artifact stored securely in AWS S3. Subsequently, the application deployment takes place on an AWS EC2 instance through CodeDeploy, ensuring efficient and scalable deployment processes.

Key Skills:
- AWS EC2
- AWS IAM User & Role Management
- AWS S3
- AWS CodeCommit
- AWS CodeBuild
- AWS CodeDeploy
- AWS CodePipeline
- AWS KMS (Key Management Service)
- Artifacts Management
- YAML Configuration
- VS Code (Visual Studio Code)

Milestones:
1Ô∏è‚É£ **CodeCommit Setup**: Establishing the foundation by integrating CodeCommit for version control.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **CodeBuild Execution**: Configuring CodeBuild to compile the code and generate a deployable artifact.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Artifact Storage in AWS S3**: Storing the generated artifact securely in AWS S3 for accessibility and versioning.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **CodeDeploy Deployment**: Ensuring seamless application deployment on AWS EC2 through CodeDeploy.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **CodePipeline Creation**: The grand finale involves building an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, connecting all the pieces seamlessly.

Stay tuned for updates as I navigate through these AWS services, employing best practices and optimizing the deployment pipeline. Let's innovate together! üíªüöÄ #AWS #DevOps #CI/CD #CodePipeline #CodeCommit #CodeBuild #CodeDeploy
